\hypertarget{index_First}{}\section{Project\textquotesingle{}s aim}\label{index_First}
The aim of this project is to create an application to save information for different trips. In order to use the application every user should create his own profile by registering\mbox{[}saving his personal data(username, password and email) to a database\mbox{]}. After registering a personal database must be created where all trips of the user will be saved. Every trip should have a destination(location), time period, grade(between 1-\/5), comment and photos. Also every user can have friends with whom he can share information. Moreover he can see where his friends have been and what was their impression of the trip(grade and comment).\hypertarget{index_Github}{}\subsection{Github}\label{index_Github}
